# GaussianNB-vs-MultinomialNB-on-wine-dataset
This repository is a comparison of the Gaussian naive bayes algorithm and the Multinomial naive bayes algorithm on the wine dataset from sklearn.datasets.

The Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm showed a 98% accuracy(approximately), while the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm showed a 85% accuracy(approximately).

The analysis was done by using both the GaussianNB and MultinomialNB classes, and also by comparing the 2 algorithms using k fold cross validation.
